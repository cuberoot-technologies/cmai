			<p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
				The Carbon Markets Association of India (CMAI) is a leading not-for-profit group of industry
				stakeholders dedicated to accelerating India’s transition to a sustainable, net-zero future.
				As a strategic alliance of industry experts, policymakers, and global stakeholders, CMAI
				aims to develop a robust carbon credit market and drive India’s climate and sustainability
				goals
				<br />
				<br />
				CMAI collaborates closely with key ministries such as ICVCM, India’s MoEFCC, MoP, MNRE, and NITI
				Aayog, providing policy advocacy and knowledge support. It plays a pivotal role in initiatives
				like the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) and the Green Credit Programme (GCP), ensuring alignment
				with global standards and promoting climate justice.
				<br />
				<br />

				We equip stakeholders through capacity-building programs, training workshops, and grassroots
				campaigns. With members like Indian Oil, Tata Power, Reliance, and more, CMAI integrates
				carbon market mechanisms into sectors like agriculture and renewable energy while fostering
				international collaborations for sustainable solutions.
				<br />
				<br />

				CMAI has supported over 3,500 projects, reducing 220 million tons of GHG emissions and
				actively participates in global climate negotiations. Beyond carbon markets, CMAI champions
				innovations like the India Clean Cooking Alliance, India EPR Alliance, Centre of Excellence
				ANT initiative, and biodiversity conservation among others, advancing solutions that
				harmonize economic growth and environmental stewardship.

			As the world prepares for COP30 in Belém, Brazil, the Carbon Market Association of India (CMAI) will lead an Indian delegation to engage in critical negotiations and global climate discussions. 
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700"></p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            The delegation will comprise industry leaders, climate experts, policymakers, and clean-tech innovators, representing India’s evolving climate action landscape. CMAI’s participation aims to highlight India’s carbon market progress, showcase voluntary and compliance market innovations, and foster international partnerships to enhance ambition and implementation. With Article 6 mechanisms taking shape and climate finance gaining traction, COP30 presents a strategic opportunity for Indian stakeholders to contribute to and influence global frameworks.

			CMAI will also host side events, bilateral meetings, and showcase sessions to amplify India’s voice in carbon governance and market development. The association’s presence underscores its growing role as a policy partner and thought leader in global climate diplomacy, while reinforcing its mission to shape an equitable and effective global carbon market aligned with India’s development priorities.

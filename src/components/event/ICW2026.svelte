		<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
			The India Carbon Policy Development Conclave 2025, convened by the Carbon Market Association of India (CMAI), will serve as a pivotal forum for steering the evolution of India’s carbon market policy architecture. 
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700"></p>

		<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            As the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS) gains ground and voluntary market mechanisms continue to evolve, the conclave aims to bring together policymakers, regulators, climate financiers, and industry stakeholders to explore policy coherence, market readiness, and investment enablers. 
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            With a structured agenda encompassing regulatory frameworks, institutional roles, crediting methodologies, and MRV systems, the event will offer deep dives into domestic and international best practices. Participants will examine the interplay between Article 6.2 frameworks, private sector ambition, and national climate targets, ensuring alignment between climate objectives and economic growth. 

		</p>


        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700">
            The conclave will also serve as a launchpad for new initiatives, consultations, and collaborative strategies to catalyse India’s carbon market ecosystem. Positioned at the intersection of policy and practice, the Carbon Policy Development Conclave reaffirms CMAI’s vision of shaping transparent, dynamic, and scalable carbon markets for a net-zero future.

			After the resounding success of its inaugural edition, India Climate Week returns in 2026 with renewed ambition and expanded scope. Organised by the Carbon Market Association of India (CMAI), the second edition of this annual event aims to advance the conversation around climate action policies and galvanise a collective response to the climate crisis. Set against the backdrop of evolving global climate commitments, India Climate Week 2026 will bring together thought leaders, policy influencers, innovators, and global collaborators to foster partnerships for scalable solutions.

			Through a week-long series of dialogues, exhibitions, workshops, and sector-specific roundtables, the event will explore critical areas such as energy transition, carbon markets, climate finance, and adaptation pathways. With an emphasis on action-oriented outcomes, this edition is designed to spark cross-sector collaboration, elevate regional voices, and align India’s ambitions with global climate goals.

        <p class="mb-4 text-gray-700 text-xl">
            The conclave will also serve as a launchpad for new initiatives, consultations, and collaborative strategies to catalyse India’s carbon market ecosystem. Positioned at the intersection of policy and practice, the Carbon Policy Development Conclave reaffirms CMAI’s vision of shaping transparent, dynamic, and scalable carbon markets for a net-zero future.

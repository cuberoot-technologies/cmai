		<p class="mb-4 text-xl text-gray-700">
			India stands at a pivotal juncture in its aviation journey. As the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market by passenger numbers—trailing only the United States and China—India is poised for exponential growth. Passenger volumes are projected to double within the next decade, underscoring the urgent need to align this expansion with environmental sustainability. While aviation contributes 2–3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the sector also presents a unique opportunity for transformative climate action through the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).
		</p>
		<p class="mb-4 text-xl text-gray-700">The India SAF Conclave is a pioneering national initiative, organized by the SAF Association in collaboration with the Carbon Markets Association of India (CMAI) as a strategic partner. This first-of-its-kind platform aims to catalyze the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) movement in India. Bringing together a diverse coalition of stakeholders—from government policymakers and SAF producers to airlines, airports, investors, and research institutions—the Conclave will serve as a collaborative hub for charting India’s SAF roadmap. The event will spotlight innovation, streamline supply chain integration, and foster public-private partnerships to scale up SAF production and deployment. The conclave will address pressing issues such as investment frameworks, regulatory clarity, technological breakthroughs, logistics optimization, and feedstock diversification. The India SAF Conclave reflects a national vision to turn environmental responsibility into economic opportunity and technological leadership.</p>

		In a significant step towards climate action, at COP26, India committed to a target of net-zero
		greenhouse gas emissions by 2070. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also proposed a five-fold
		strategy for India, named “Panchamrita’s”:

	<ul class="list-disc pl-5">
		<li class="text-l mt-4 text-gray-600">India will take its non-fossil energy capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030</li>

		<li class="text-l mt-4 text-gray-600">India will meet 50 percent of its energy requirements with renewable sources by 2030</li>
		<li class="text-l mt-4 text-gray-600">India will reduce its carbon emission intensity by 45 percent by 2030</li>
		<li class="text-l mt-4 text-gray-600">India will achieve net-zero by 2070</li>

		In its NDCs submitted under the Paris Agreement in 2015, India had promised to reduce its ‘emissions intensity’ by 33% to 35% and that at least 40% of its installed capacity of electricity generation would come through non fossil-fuel based energy sources by 2030. Hon’ble PM Modi enhanced both these targets at COP26 raising the emissions intensity reduction target to 45% and the share of renewables in installed electricity capacity has been increased to 50%.

There is scope for an increased climate action in India. We are therefore building an ecosystem in India where everyone – from businesses and public sector organizations to individuals and think tanks – collaborate to achieve the goal of net-zero and ensure a sustainable tomorrow.
		<br />
		<br />

		We want to enable India to stride faster towards its goal of net-zero by 2070. We work with PSUs, municipal corporations, private sector think tanks and state governments to steer the efforts towards carbon neutrality.
